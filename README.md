# Sudoku-Solver
Program that solves sudoku with backtracking
For console application
Firstly, Program asks how many numbers are given for example if the board already has 20 numbers given then you enter 20,then it will ask user to enter first number given followed by position of that number.
The position system works in range 1-81 where 1 is top left of board and 81 is bottom right of the board and values are incremented from left to right so for example 10 is row 2 column 1.(Will add Gui with Wpf to make process easier and quicker)
